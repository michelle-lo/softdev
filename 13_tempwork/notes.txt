K13 - Template for Success/Using Flask/Creating flask app using the occupation python data 
October 13 2021

Notes:
- Angela and Deven had similar python implementations of occupation because they imported the file into their new directories. 
Michelle recreated the functions in the various assignments rather than import. 
- We used Michelle's method so that our file tree would match the given one. 

Discoveries:
- Adding more @app.route("/") creates more websites built off of the home http://127.0.0.1:5000/.
- We learned about this last assignment but the {% for ... %} can create python for loops within the HTML code. The {% end for %} is necessary. 

Questions:
- Implementing Reng's debugging method??

Ego:
- Owning a program is different from owning a building or art: it is more objectively judged and can limit a programmer from taking criticism and improving. 
- Cognitive Dissonance:
    - Dissonance must be healed psychologically, but it will not be through a person's self-image which extends to their code. 
    - Eventually, suggestions must be taken into account. But time can be wasted due to limiting the scope of criticism and education.
    - The "it's not my fault" excuse when coding
- Working in groups helps alleviate this defense mechanism. Sharing code, finding bugs, and disassociating files from oneself can make it easier to find and fix errors.
