K34 -- Intro Video with Data Modeling
2022-04-27

Genkina's Intro Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GHZd0zv170

* What is RBBMS?
* Develop application + define data model + improve app + improve data model
* Iterative design
* Linking: one-to-one, one-to-many (array), many-to-many (arrays on either side) (eg entities and relationships in a blog)
* To link or embed(and link)?
* Update schema
* Tabular approach: new document for every reading
* Document approach: bucket pattern, stores small, related data items, reduces index sees, speed of retrieval reduced
* Computed Pattern: compute as it reads -> updating database and update summary records too (caching pattern), less work (like you're multitasking)
* Simpler models: embedding, few patterns. Complex Models:  embedding and linking, many patterns.

What is MongoDB Database?
* A database, structured in an organized way but no rows and columns or tables.
* NoSQL documentDB. Data is stored as documents. Stored in collections.
* Collection - an organized store of documents in MongoDB usually with common fields between documents. There can be many collections per database and many documents per collection.

What is a Document in MongoDB?
* Organize and store data as a set of friend-value pairs eg "title" : "Team Lead"
* Collection: org store of documents

Document - a way to organize and store data as a set of field-value pairs.

Field - a unique identifier for a datapoint.

Value - data related to a given identifier.

Collection - an organized store of documents in MongoDB, usually with common fields between documents. There can be many collections per database and many documents per collection.

What is MongoDB Atlas?
* Data will remain intact. Clusters: group of servers that stores your data.
* Alas: manage cluster creation.

Replica Set - a few connected machines that store the same data to ensure that if something happens to one of the machines the data will remain intact. Comes from the word replicate - to copy something.

Instance - a single machine locally or in the cloud, running a certain software, in our case it is the MongoDB database. (part of the replica set)

Cluster - group of servers that store your data.
