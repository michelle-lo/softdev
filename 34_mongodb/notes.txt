* What is RBBMS?
* Develop application + define data model + improve app + improve data model
* Iterative design
* Linking: one-to-one, one-to-many (array), many-to-many (arrays on either side) (eg entities and relationships in a blog)
* To link or embed(and link)?
* Update schema
* Tabular approach: new document for every reading
* Document approach: bucket pattern, stores small, related data items, reduces index sees, speed of retrieval reduced
* Computed Pattern: compute as it reads -> updating database and update summary records too (caching pattern), less work (like you're multitasking)
* Simpler models: embedding, few patterns. Complex Models:  embedding and linking, many patterns.
