K34 -- Intro Video with Data Modeling
2022-04-27

Genkina's Intro Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GHZd0zv170

* What is RBBMS?
* Develop application + define data model + improve app + improve data model
* Iterative design
* Linking: one-to-one, one-to-many (array), many-to-many (arrays on either side) (eg entities and relationships in a blog)
* To link or embed(and link)?
* Update schema
* Tabular approach: new document for every reading
* Document approach: bucket pattern, stores small, related data items, reduces index sees, speed of retrieval reduced
* Computed Pattern: compute as it reads -> updating database and update summary records too (caching pattern), less work (like you're multitasking)
* Simpler models: embedding, few patterns. Complex Models:  embedding and linking, many patterns.

K35 -- Chapter 1: What is MongoDB?
2022-05-03

Chapter 1: https://university.mongodb.com/mercury/M001/2022_April_26/chapter/Chapter_1_What_is_MongoDB_/lesson/5f32c8a304e9ffbb03b169ac/lecture

What is MongoDB Database?
* A database, structured in an organized way but no rows and columns or tables.
* NoSQL documentDB. Data is stored as documents. Stored in collections.
* Collection - an organized store of documents in MongoDB usually with common fields between documents. There can be many collections per database and many documents per collection.

What is a Document in MongoDB?
* Organize and store data as a set of friend-value pairs eg "title" : "Team Lead"
* Collection: org store of documents

Document - a way to organize and store data as a set of field-value pairs.

Field - a unique identifier for a datapoint.

Value - data related to a given identifier.

Collection - an organized store of documents in MongoDB, usually with common fields between documents. There can be many collections per database and many documents per collection.

What is MongoDB Atlas?
* Data will remain intact. Clusters: group of servers that stores your data.
* Alas: manage cluster creation.

Replica Set - a few connected machines that store the same data to ensure that if something happens to one of the machines the data will remain intact. Comes from the word replicate - to copy something.

Instance - a single machine locally or in the cloud, running a certain software, in our case it is the MongoDB database. (part of the replica set)

Cluster - group of servers that store your data.

K36 -- Chapter 2: Importing, Exporting, and Querying Data
2022-05-03

Chapter 2: https://university.mongodb.com/mercury/M001/2022_April_26/chapter/Chapter_2_Importing_Exporting_and_Querying_Data/lesson/5f356aeb32339e734c9da867/lecture

How does MongoDB store data?
* working in JSON (starts and ends in {}, key and value sep by :, key:value sep by comma, keys surrounded by "") (keys -> fields in MongoDB)
* subdocuments
* BSON (binary JSON) - gap between binary rep and JSON format, high purpose
* MongoDB stores data in BSON, view in JSON

Importing and Exporting Data
* Stored BSON vs Viewed JSON
* JSON: mongoimport, mongoexport
* BSON: mongorestore, mongodump
* mongodump: exprorts data in BSON (not easy to read)
* URI string: uniform resource identifier.
* mongorestore --uri "<atlas cluster URI>"
	       --drop dump (drop -> removes existing database)
* mongoimport --uri "<atlas cluster URI>"
	      --drop=<filename>.json
-> imports data in JSON 

mongoimport can import data from JSON, and other supported non BSON formats. Can add a collection to the Atlas cluster.
mongodump exports data in its raw BSON form.
mongorestore imports data from a mongodump created BSON format.
mongoexport can export data from JSON.

Data Explorer
* query data using the GUI.
* must use valid JSON

Find Command
* admin: tracks existing users in db
* show dbs -> shows databases in the clusters
1. use sample_training
2. show collections
db.{collection_name}.find( query )

* it : iterates through a cursor
* cursor: pointer to a result set of a query
* pointer: direct address to a memory location
 
db.zips.find({"state": "NY"}).count() -> counts the documents with state of NY
db.zips.find({"state": "NY", "city": "ALBANY"}).pretty() -> easier to read

show dbs, show collections, find(), count(), pretty()

K37 -- Chapter 3: Creating and Manipulating Documents
2022-05-09

Inserting New Documents - ObjectId
* every document must have a unique _id value.
* ObjectId() -> is the default value (unless stated in parentheses)

Inserting New Documents - insert() and errors
* --drop "collection" - drops the collection
* use _database_, db._collection_.findOne() -> one random document
* db._collection_.insert(^^)
* object id is added automatically when inserting document. mongoldb allows you to add identical documents as long as their _id values are different.


Inserting New Documents - insert() order
* when many docs are inserted, they are inserted in the order of the array -> duplicate docs after the first one will not be added, others with unique ids will be added
* db.inspections.insert([{ "_id": 1, "test": 1 },{ "_id": 1, "test": 2 },
                       { "_id": 3, "test": 3 }],{ "ordered": false }) 
-> ordered: true --> all duplicate documents are not inserted nor are others inserted (the process is halted)

Updating Documents - Data Explorer
* MongoDB has a flexible data model, which means that you can have fields that contain documents, or arrays as their values.

Updating Documents - mongo shell
* updateOne() - only first found will be updated, updateMany() - update all docs that match query, findOne(), find()
* $inc -> increment value by spec value
* db.zips.updateMany({ "city": "HUDSON" }, { "$inc": { "pop": 10 } })
* $set - sets value
* db.zips.updateOne({ "zip": "12534" }, { "$set": { "pop": 17630 } }) 
* $push element -> add element
* db.grades.updateOne({ "student_id": 250, "class_id": 339 },
                    { "$push": { "scores": { "type": "extra credit",
                                             "score": 100 }
                                }
                     })
* $set can add new fields if they are not already created

Deleting Documents and Collections
* deleteOne() -> query by using "_id" value, deleteMany()
* db.<collection>.drop()
* removing all collections also removes the database

K38 -- Chapter 4: Advanced CRUD Operations
2022-05-09

Query Operators - Comparison
* query operators -> additional ways to locate data
* $ -> precedes MQL operators, precedes aggregate pipeline stages, allows access to field values
* $eq - equal to
* $ne - not equal to
* $gt - greater than
* lt - less than
* gte - greater than or equal to
* lte - less than or equal to
* {<field>: {<operator>: <value>}} 

Query Operators - Logic
* $and - match all
* $or - at least one
* $nor - fail to match both cases
* $not - negates the query req
* $and -> default operator when operator is not specified 
* explicit $and - using same operator more than once
* {"$<operator>": [{<clause1>}, {clause2>}]} 
{$not: {<clause>}}

db.routes.find({ "$and": [ { "$or" :[ { "dst_airport": "KZN" },
                                    { "src_airport": "KZN" }
                                  ] },
                          { "$or" :[ { "airplane": "CR2" },
                                     { "airplane": "A81" } ] }
                         ]}).pretty()

db.zips.find({"pop": {"$lt": 1000000, "$gt": 5000}}).pretty()

db.companies.find({ "$and": [
                        { "$or": [ { "founded_year": 2004 },
                                   { "founded_month": 10 } ] },
                        { "$or": [ { "category_code": "web" },
                                   { "category_code": "social" }]}]}).count()

Expressive Query Operator
* $expr : allows to use of aggregation expressions within query language
* {$expr: {<expression>}}
* allows us to use variables and conditional statements
* db.trips.find({ "$expr": { "$eq": [ "$end station id", "$start station id"] }
              }).count()

Which of the following statements will find all the companies that have more employees than the year in which they were founded?

db.companies.find(
    { "$expr": { "$gt": [ "$number_of_employees", "$founded_year" ]} }
  ).count()

db.companies.find({$expr: {$eq: ["$permalink", "$twitter_username"]}}).count()

db.companies.find({ 
    $expr:  { $eq: ["$permalink", "$twitter_username"] }
}).count()

Array Operators
$all, $size - array length
* {<array field> : {"$size": <number}}
specified array field is exactly the given length

* {<array field> : {"$all": <array}}
documents contains all given elements, regardless of order

What is the name of the listing in the sample_airbnb.listingsAndReviews dataset that accommodates more than 6 people and has exactly 50 reviews?

db.listingsAndReviews.find({"listing_id": 10091713})


Array Operators and Projection
* projection will only include specific fields 

projection syntax
db.<collection>.find({<query>}, {<projection>})
1 - include field, 0 - exclude field
use only 1s or only 0s


db.<collection>.find({<query>}, {<field1>: 1, <field2>: 1})
exception:
db.<collection>.find({<query>}, {<field1>: 1, "_id": 0})

{<field>: {"$eleMatch": {<field>: <value>}}}
Matches documents that contain an array field with at least one element that matches the specified query criteria

db.companies.find({ "offices": { "$elemMatch": { "city": "Seattle" } }
                  }).count()

Array Operators and Sub-Documents
* dot notation - nested arrays
