K08 -- Learning from each other’s work

Questions
How does debug work and how can we use it?
Is there a “best” solution?
What’s the best solution for larger lists of values? Less memory?

Comments
Renggeng uses DEBUG to ease his progamming.
We all have identical, or at least very similar strategies for weighted probabilities.
Reng notes that tracker and s > r is different from s >= r because it reduces the possibility of rolling a number like 99.8.

Concerns
There probably could’ve been more commenting on my work.
Are there any perceived risks with using our “interval” strategy? For example, is it truly random? Does it favor the beginning over the ending?
